License: LGPL-2.1+
 Libwebsockets and included programs are provided under the terms of the GNU
 Library General Public License (LGPL) 2.1, with the following exceptions:
 .
 1) Static linking of programs with the libwebsockets library does not
 constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
 source code for the program, use the shared libwebsockets libraries, or
 link their program against a user-supplied version of libwebsockets.
 .
 If you link the program to a modified version of libwebsockets, then the
 changes to libwebsockets must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
 sections 1, 2, and 4.
 .
 2) You do not have to provide a copy of the libwebsockets license with
 programs that are linked to the libwebsockets library, nor do you have to
 identify the libwebsockets license in your program or documentation as
 required by section 6 of the LGPL.
 .
 However, programs must still identify their use of libwebsockets. The
 following example statement can be included in user documentation to
 satisfy this requirement:
 .
 "[program] is based in part on the work of the libwebsockets  project
 (http://libwebsockets.org)"
 .
